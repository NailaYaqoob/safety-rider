"""Dashboard API: page, snapshot, SSE stream, and the demo simulator.

Endpoints
---------
``GET  /dashboard``                  the page itself
``GET  /api/dashboard/state``        riders + recent events, for first paint
``GET  /api/dashboard/stream``       Server-Sent Events, one per evaluation
``POST /api/dashboard/simulate``     force a heat spike (demo only)

SSE rather than WebSockets: the traffic is one-way, it is plain HTTP so it
survives the Cloudflare tunnel without an upgrade handshake, and ``EventSource``
reconnects on its own — during a live pitch that last property matters more
than anything a socket would buy.
